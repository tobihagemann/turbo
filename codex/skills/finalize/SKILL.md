# Finalize Implementation

Post-implementation QA workflow: tests, code polishing, commit, and self-improvement.

## Task Tracking

At the start, use `update_plan` to track each phase:

1. Run `$polish-code` skill
2. Run `$update-changelog` skill
3. Run `$self-improve` skill
4. Ship It

## Phase 1: Run `$polish-code` Skill

Run the `$polish-code` skill for the current changes.

## Phase 2: Run `$update-changelog` Skill

Run the `$update-changelog` skill.

## Phase 3: Run `$self-improve` Skill

Run the `$self-improve` skill for the current session. Always run this phase even if the session seemed routine.

## Phase 4: Ship It

### Step 1: Analyze Split

Examine the staged changes and evaluate whether they should be split into multiple commits, branches, and PRs for reviewability.

Detect the repository's default branch via `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name'`. Check the current branch name and whether a PR already exists for it using `gh pr view`. If a PR exists, read its title and description to understand the branch's purpose. This context informs which changes belong on the current branch and which should be split off.

Run `git diff --cached --stat` and `git diff --cached` to understand the scope. Categorize changes along three dimensions:

- **Concern type**: refactoring, bug fix, new feature, cleanup, dependency update
- **Layer/domain**: backend, frontend, database migrations, i18n, tests, configuration
- **Logical unit**: files that form a coherent, independently reviewable change

A split is warranted when the staged changes contain multiple reviewable units. Each unit should be independently understandable, testable, and revertable. When deciding group boundaries, consider whether a reviewer could evaluate each group without needing context from the others.

### Step 2: Present Analysis and Choose Path

Output the split analysis as text.

If changes form a single cohesive unit, note this and run the `$ship` skill.

If changes span multiple reviewable units, propose an ordered list of groups. For each group, specify:

- Name and one-line description
- File list (flag files with mixed-concern hunks)
- Branch topology: stacked on the previous group (when this group depends on it) or independent (when it can stand alone)

Use `request_user_input` to let the user choose: ship as a single commit/PR, or split.

- **Ship** — run the `$ship` skill
- **Split** — run the `$split-and-ship` skill

Then update or check the active plan and proceed to any remaining task.

## Rules

- Diff size, number of files changed, passing tests, perceived user urgency, or context window concerns are not reasons to skip a phase. Each phase does work beyond what those signals cover. "The session was long" or "a prior phase was thorough" are never valid reasons to skip a later phase.
- Never stage or commit files containing secrets (`.env`, credentials, API keys). Warn if detected.
- Do not present diffs to the user — the user reviews diffs in an external git client. Use `git diff` internally as needed.
- If a non-test step fails (polish, review), stop and report the failure. Do not skip ahead.
