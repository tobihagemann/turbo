# Contribute Turbo

Submit staged turbo skill improvements from `~/.turbo/repo/` back to the upstream repo. The workflow adapts based on `repoMode` in `~/.turbo/config.json`.

## Step 1: Verify Contributor Status

Read `~/.turbo/config.json` and check `repoMode`:

- `"fork"` or `"source"` — proceed
- `"clone"` — tell the user that contributions require a fork. Offer to help convert their clone to a fork (add their fork as origin, rename current origin to upstream). Stop.
- Missing config or repo — tell the user to run the Turbo setup first. Stop.

Verify the repo exists and has the expected remotes:

```bash
git -C ~/.turbo/repo remote -v
```

## Step 2: Mirror Installed Skill Changes

Port session corrections from `~/.agents/skills/<name>/` (where edits land first) into `~/.turbo/repo/codex/skills/<name>/` (the basis for the contribution), leaving any persistent local customizations in the installed copy untouched.

Detect drifted skills:

```bash
for skill in ~/.agents/skills/*/; do
  name=$(basename "$skill")
  repo_dir=~/.turbo/repo/codex/skills/"$name"
  [ -d "$repo_dir" ] || continue
  diff -rq "$skill" "$repo_dir" >/dev/null 2>&1 && continue
  echo "$name"
done
```

For each drifted skill, first check whether the repo copy already has unstaged changes for it (`git -C ~/.turbo/repo status --porcelain codex/skills/<name>/`). If it does, use `request_user_input` to ask the user how to proceed before mirroring — those changes will conflate with mirrored corrections in Step 3 if not resolved.

Then read both versions of every changed file and classify each hunk:

- **Correction** — a session edit meant to improve the skill upstream. For modified files and new files, mirror the change into the repo copy with `apply_patch`. For files deleted from the installed copy, remove the repo copy with `rm`.
- **Customization** — a persistent local addition that does not belong upstream (extra workflow steps, personal paths, machine-specific notes, internal references). Leave it in the installed copy; do not propagate.
- **Ambiguous** — use `request_user_input` to confirm classification before applying.

## Step 3: Check Cross-Edition Sync

Before staging, check whether the Codex paths drifted in Step 2 have parallel files in the Claude edition that should be updated alongside them:

- `codex/skills/<name>/` ↔ `claude/skills/<name>/`
- `codex/SKILL-CONVENTIONS.md` ↔ `claude/SKILL-CONVENTIONS.md`
- `codex/ADDITIONS.md` ↔ `claude/ADDITIONS.md`
- `codex/SETUP.md` ↔ `claude/SETUP.md`
- `codex/UPDATE.md` ↔ `claude/UPDATE.md`
- `codex/MIGRATION.md` ↔ `claude/MIGRATION.md`

For each Codex path with pending changes, check whether the Claude sibling exists in `~/.turbo/repo/claude/` and whether the local repo already has matching changes for it (`git -C ~/.turbo/repo status --porcelain claude/<path>`). If a Claude sibling exists but has no matching changes, use `request_user_input`:

> The change to `codex/<path>` touches the Codex edition, but `claude/<path>` exists and has no matching change. Does the Claude sibling need the same update?

Options:

- **Yes, I need to update the Claude sibling** — Stop. The user manually edits `~/.turbo/repo/claude/<path>` (vocabulary differs; only behavioral parity is required) and re-runs this skill.
- **No, this is Codex-specific** — Continue.

If any sibling-update answer is "Yes", stop the workflow. Nothing has been staged yet, so there is no state to clean up before re-running.

## Step 4: Review Pending Changes

Check what changes exist in the local repo:

```bash
git -C ~/.turbo/repo diff --name-only
git -C ~/.turbo/repo diff --cached --name-only
```

If there are unstaged changes to skill files, stage the specific skill directories that changed (both editions, when sibling updates landed in Step 3):

```bash
git -C ~/.turbo/repo add codex/skills/<name>/
git -C ~/.turbo/repo add claude/skills/<name>/   # if a sibling was updated
```

If there are no changes at all, tell the user there is nothing to contribute and stop.

Present the changes in a summary table:

```
| # | Skill | Change Summary |
|---|-------|----------------|
| 1 | $evaluate-findings | Added handling for security-default findings |
| 2 | $self-improve | Clarified routing for trusted reviewer feedback |
```

Use `request_user_input` to confirm which changes to include. If the user deselects some, unstage those files.

## Step 5: Validate Skill Quality

Read `~/.turbo/repo/codex/SKILL-CONVENTIONS.md` for the turbo project's skill conventions. These conventions supplement `$create-skill`'s general best practices with turbo-specific patterns.

For each confirmed skill, if `$create-skill` has not been invoked for it in this session, run `$create-skill` to review and refine the skill. Any improvements from the review become part of the contribution.

## Step 6: Craft Contribution Context

For each change, construct a "why" explanation. The goal: the turbo maintainer should understand what happened and why the existing instructions were insufficient, without learning anything about the contributor's project.

Use this template:

> During [general workflow description], the skill's instructions [what was missing or wrong]. This caused [what happened]. The change [what it does] so that [benefit].

**Example:**

> During a code review session, the evaluate-findings skill encountered a finding with `security-default` severity. The existing instructions only handled `critical`, `high`, `medium`, and `low` severities, causing the finding to be silently dropped. The change adds `security-default` to the severity handling table so these findings are properly triaged.

### Privacy Filter

Before finalizing, verify each "why" description contains none of the following:

- Project or repo names
- File paths from the user's project
- Company or product names
- API keys, URLs, or credentials
- Business logic or domain-specific terminology that identifies the project
- User names beyond the contributor's GitHub handle

Output the drafted context as text. Then use `request_user_input` for approval. The user must approve the contribution message before proceeding.

## Step 7: Commit Rules

Run `$commit-rules` to load commit message rules and technical constraints.

## Step 8: Create Branch and Commit

When multiple skills were changed, batch related changes into a single branch and commit. Create separate branches only when changes are independent and unrelated.

### Fork mode

Create a feature branch:

```bash
git -C ~/.turbo/repo checkout -b improve/<skill-name>-<short-desc>
```

Commit with a message matching the turbo repo style (check `git -C ~/.turbo/repo log -n 10 --oneline`). Incorporate the "why" context in the commit message.

### Source mode

Stay on main. Commit directly with the same message style.

## Step 9: Push

### Fork mode

Run `$github-voice` to load writing style rules.

Push and create a PR:

```bash
git -C ~/.turbo/repo push -u origin improve/<skill-name>-<short-desc>
```

Create the PR against the upstream repo:

```bash
gh pr create --repo tobihagemann/turbo --head <user>:improve/<skill-name>-<short-desc> --title "..." --body "..."
```

PR body format:

```markdown
## Summary
- [1-3 bullet points]

## Context
[The crafted "why" explanation from Step 6]
```

Return to main after creating the PR:

```bash
git -C ~/.turbo/repo checkout main
```

Report the PR URL.

### Source mode

Pull and rebase before pushing to incorporate any upstream changes:

```bash
git -C ~/.turbo/repo pull --rebase origin main
```

If the rebase pulled in new commits, run `$update-turbo` to apply upstream changes (skill updates, migrations, config changes) to the local installation before pushing.

Then push:

```bash
git -C ~/.turbo/repo push origin main
```

Report the pushed commit hash.

## Step 10: Update Config

In source mode, update `~/.turbo/config.json` so the next `$update-turbo` does not re-surface the just-pushed changes:

1. Read `~/.turbo/config.json`
2. Set `codex.lastUpdateHead` (creating the `codex` object or key if missing) to the current HEAD: `git -C ~/.turbo/repo rev-parse HEAD`
3. Write the updated config back

Report that the contribution is complete.

Skip this step in fork mode (the upstream has not changed until the PR is merged).

Then call `update_plan` to mark this step completed and continue with the next step of the active workflow.
