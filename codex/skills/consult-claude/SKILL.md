# Consult Claude

Use Claude Code as an external collaborator from Codex. Unlike `$peer-review`, this skill is conversational and exploratory.

## Step 1: Define the Question

State:

- What problem needs input
- What has already been tried
- What files, commands, plans, or error messages matter
- What kind of answer is useful: hypotheses, tradeoffs, concrete fix, or review

## Step 2: Run `$claude-print` Skill

Run the `$claude-print` skill with the assembled question. Default to read-only permissions.

For follow-up questions, include Claude's previous answer and the new evidence gathered since then.

## Step 3: Synthesize

Summarize the useful parts of Claude's response. Cross-reference suggestions with the repository before acting.

Then call `update_plan` to mark this step completed and continue with the next step of the active workflow.

## Rules

- Claude's answer is advisory.
- Do not apply a suggestion until it has been checked against the actual codebase.
- Keep each Claude turn focused on one question.
