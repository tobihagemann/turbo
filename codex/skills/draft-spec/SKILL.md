# Draft Spec

Guide a collaborative discussion to explore a project idea, then synthesize the conversation into a comprehensive specification at `.turbo/specs/<slug>.md`.

## Task Tracking

At the start, use `update_plan` to track each step, restating any remaining steps of a parent workflow alongside them:

1. Capture the vision and pick a slug
2. Consult task-specific skills and docs
3. Deep-dive discussion
4. Draft the spec
5. Resolve open questions
6. Present and finalize

## Step 1: Capture the Vision and Pick a Slug

Absorb whatever the user has provided — a sentence, a paragraph, a brain dump. Do not interrupt or ask questions yet. Restate the vision back in two or three sentences to confirm understanding.

Pick a slug for the spec file derived from the project or feature name:

- Lowercase
- Replace non-alphanumeric characters with hyphens
- Collapse consecutive hyphens
- Trim leading and trailing hyphens
- Truncate to 40 characters at a word boundary

Example: "Photo Sorter v2" → `photo-sorter-v2`. The user may pass an explicit slug; if so, honor it.

If `.turbo/specs/<slug>.md` already exists, use `request_user_input` to ask whether to overwrite, append a numeric suffix (`-2`, `-3`, ...), or pick a different slug.

State the chosen slug and the resulting spec path before continuing.

Then use `request_user_input` to ask 1-3 focused opening questions targeting the biggest unknowns. Skip anything the user already answered. Prioritize from:

- What problem does this solve, and for whom?
- Is this greenfield or does existing code/infrastructure exist?
- Are there strong technology preferences or constraints?
- What does the MVP look like versus the full vision?
- Are there hard deadlines, budget limits, or team size constraints?

## Step 2: Consult Task-Specific Skills and Docs

Ground architecture and tech-stack choices in current reality before the deep-dive discussion.

1. **Scan for matching skills.** Compare the vision and opening-question answers against available skill trigger descriptions. For each unambiguous match, run the skill by reading and following the installed skill instructions. This loads decision-level guidance (idiomatic patterns, known pitfalls, version constraints) before architectural choices are made. If unsure, do not load.
2. **Look up library or framework docs.** For any library, framework, or platform the user mentioned or the project clearly needs, query documentation MCP tools (or WebSearch as a fallback) when the decision hinges on current capabilities, supported versions, or known constraints.

Keep findings at the decision level: what tools can do, which approaches are idiomatic, which versions to target. Do not embed specific API signatures or code snippets into the spec. Those belong in implementation-time skill loads.

## Step 3: Deep-Dive Discussion

Interview the user relentlessly until you reach shared understanding of the project. Gather behavioral requirements (the "what") before architectural design (the "how"), so design decisions land against a concrete set of requirements instead of being taken in the abstract. Track coverage internally but do not present the list as a rigid checklist. When the user jumps to architecture early, engage briefly then circle back to confirm the behavioral picture is complete.

### Requirements (gather first)

| Category | What to explore |
|---|---|
| **Users and personas** | Who uses this? Goals, pain points, technical sophistication |
| **Core behaviors** | Primary capabilities and user-facing workflows — the behaviors the system must exhibit |
| **Non-functional requirements** | Performance, security, accessibility, i18n, compliance — which of these do this project's users and deployment require? |
| **Scale and operational rigor** | How many users and operators, now and realistically? Concurrent writers? Which rigor tier is proportionate — personal tool, small team, or business-critical — and what failure tolerance does that imply? |

### Design (gather after requirements are clear)

| Category | What to explore |
|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Client/server split, monolith vs services, real-time needs, offline support |
| **Tech stack** | Languages, frameworks, databases, hosting — preferences and constraints |
| **Data model** | Key entities, relationships, storage strategy |
| **Integrations** | Third-party APIs, auth providers, external data sources |

### Cross-cutting

| Category | What to explore |
|---|---|
| **MVP scope** | What ships first? What is explicitly deferred? |
| **Open questions** | Unknowns needing research, prototyping, or external input |

### Discussion Guidelines

- If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead
- Use `request_user_input` to ask one question at a time. Use options with descriptions to frame trade-offs and offer concrete suggestions. When choices are not mutually exclusive, ask the user free-form which combination applies.
- When the user gives a short answer, probe deeper before moving on
- Offer concrete suggestions and trade-off analysis — be a collaborator, not an interviewer
- For each question, recommend an answer with reasoning
- Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one
- When all categories have sufficient depth or the user signals readiness, confirm before moving to drafting

## Step 4: Draft the Spec

Synthesize the consulted skill and doc context plus the entire discussion into `.turbo/specs/<slug>.md` using the slug picked in Step 1. Use the fixed skeleton below.

````markdown
# <Project or Feature Name>

## Overview

<One or two paragraphs stating the problem being solved and the vision for the solution.>

## Users

<Personas and their goals. Omit this section if the project has no meaningful user role distinction (e.g., a single-integrator internal library).>

## Requirements

Enumerated behavioral requirements with stable IDs. Number requirements `R1`, `R2`, `R3`, ... IDs must stay stable once drafted so downstream artifacts can reference them reliably.

Pick either format per requirement; both can appear in the same spec.

**EARS format** — for unambiguous, testable behaviors:

- **R1.** When <trigger or condition>, the system shall <expected behavior>.

Adapt the slot to the EARS pattern that fits: `When` (event-driven), `While` (state-driven), `Where` (optional feature), `If ... then` (unwanted behavior), or a bare `The system shall ...` (ubiquitous).

**User story format** — for user-facing capabilities with acceptance criteria:

- **R2.** As a <persona>, I want <capability> so that <outcome>.
  - Acceptance: <criterion 1>
  - Acceptance: <criterion 2>

Group related requirements under `### <Subheading>` when the list grows past ~8 items. IDs stay contiguous across subheadings.

## Design

Technical approach that satisfies the requirements above. Cover the elements that apply:

- **Architecture** — component split, deployment shape, communication patterns
- **Tech stack** — languages, frameworks, libraries, hosting
- **Data model** — key entities, relationships, storage strategy
- **Integrations** — third-party APIs, auth providers, external data sources
- **Key flows** — sequence or data flow for any non-trivial interaction

State decisions, not options. Where a decision was deferred, move it to Open Questions.

## MVP Scope

<What ships first versus what is explicitly deferred. Omit this section if scope is not staged.>

## Open Questions

<Unresolved decisions needing further input, research, or prototyping. Omit this section if none remain after Step 5.>
````

### Drafting Rules

- `## Overview`, `## Requirements`, and `## Design` are mandatory. `## Users`, `## MVP Scope`, and `## Open Questions` are omitted when they would be empty.
- Use concrete details from the discussion, not vague generalizations.
- Every Design element must trace to at least one requirement. If a design element has no requirement to justify it, either add the requirement or drop the element.
- Every specified component (data model entity, API endpoint, utility, service) must trace to a consumer in the spec. If a component exists only to "support future work," either spec the future work as a requirement or defer the component.
- State the deployment's bounds in the Overview or a requirement: user and operator count, concurrency, and the rigor tier the user chose.
- Consistency and durability machinery (leases, locks, queues, versioning schemes, state machines beyond simple status fields) is a cost decision. Surface it in the discussion with its carrying cost; never add it to the draft unasked.
- Where the user deferred a decision, capture it in Open Questions.
- Where recommendations were accepted, state them in Design with brief rationale.

Create the `.turbo/specs/` directory if it does not exist. Accept a different output path if the user provides one.

## Step 5: Resolve Open Questions

If the spec's Open Questions section is empty, contains "None," or does not exist, skip this step.

For each open question:

1. Analyze the question against the spec, prior discussion, and consulted-docs context from Step 2. State the trade-offs of the leading options in plain text so the user can see the reasoning.
2. Use `request_user_input` to offer up to 2 concrete resolution options with short descriptions, plus a **Defer to implementation** option (leaves the question in Open Questions to be surfaced again when shells are expanded). Mark the strongest option "(Recommended)" and place it first. The auto-appended "Other" lets the user supply a freeform answer.
3. Fold the chosen answer into the relevant spec section and remove the question from Open Questions.

If the user selects "Other" and provides a freeform answer, accept it and proceed.

Default to resolving. Defer only when the answer genuinely needs codebase or pattern-survey context that is not yet available. If every question resolves, delete the Open Questions section entirely.

## Step 6: Present and Finalize

Present a brief summary of the drafted spec: the problem, the chosen solution, and the shape of the requirements, short enough to read at a glance so the user does not have to read the full spec. Fit the summary to the spec rather than a fixed template.

Then use `request_user_input` to offer two paths:

- **Approve** (Recommended) — the spec is final.
- **Revise** — the user describes what to change, whether specific edits or areas to rethink. Apply the edits, reopening the Step 3 discussion when the change needs exploration, then re-summarize and re-present.

After approval:

> The spec is ready at the resolved spec path. To break it into shells, run `$draft-shells`.

Then call `update_plan` to mark this step completed and continue with the next step of the active workflow.

## Rules

- Never skip Step 3 — even with extensive initial context, confirm understanding and probe gaps
- The spec and workflow-state bookkeeping under `.turbo/` are the only outputs — do not create code, scaffolding, or other project files
- If the project is trivially small (single-file script, simple config), say so and suggest skipping the spec process
