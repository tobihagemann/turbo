# Refine Plan

Loop the review pipeline over a planning artifact until no new findings are accepted. Writes back to the artifact file(s) in place. Supports plans, shells, and specs.

## Task Tracking

At the start of every invocation (including re-runs from Step 5), use `update_plan` to track each step, restating any remaining steps of a parent workflow alongside them:

1. Resolve the artifact
2. Run `$review-plan` skill
3. Run `$evaluate-findings` skill
4. Run `$apply-findings` skill
5. Re-run `$refine-plan` skill if changed

## Step 1: Resolve the Artifact

### Determine Artifact Type

1. **Explicit argument** — If the user specified a type (e.g., "refine plan", "refine shells", "refine spec"), use it
2. **Conversation context** — Infer from conversation (e.g., if `$draft-plan` just ran, type is plan)
3. **Auto-detect** — Check `.turbo/` for existing artifacts. If multiple types exist, use `request_user_input`

### Resolve the Artifact File(s)

#### Plan

1. **Explicit path** — use it
2. **Explicit slug** — resolve to `.turbo/plans/<slug>.md`
3. **Single file** — Glob `.turbo/plans/*.md`. If exactly one file exists, use it
4. **Most recent** — most recently modified file
5. **Legacy fallback** — `.turbo/plan.md` if `.turbo/plans/` does not exist
6. **Nothing found** — tell the user to run `$turboplan` (for a new task) or `$pick-next-shell` (for existing shells) and stop

#### Shells

1. **Explicit spec slug** — Glob `.turbo/shells/<slug>-*.md`
2. **Explicit spec path** — derive slug from filename, glob as above
3. **Single spec** — Glob `.turbo/specs/*.md`. If exactly one, derive slug and glob for shells
4. **Most recent spec** — most recently modified spec, derive slug and glob
5. **Nothing found** — tell the user to run `$draft-shells` first and stop

For shells, read each shell file and extract from its YAML frontmatter: `spec` (source spec path) and `depends_on`. Verify the source spec exists. State the spec path, number of shells, and each shell's filename.

#### Spec

1. **Explicit path** — use it
2. **Explicit slug** — resolve to `.turbo/specs/<slug>.md`
3. **Single file** — Glob `.turbo/specs/*.md`. If exactly one, use it
4. **Most recent** — most recently modified
5. **Legacy fallback** — `.turbo/spec.md` if `.turbo/specs/` does not exist
6. **Nothing found** — tell the user to run `$draft-spec` first and stop

If multiple candidates exist and the choice is non-obvious, use `request_user_input`.

State the resolved path(s) before continuing.

## Step 2: Run `$review-plan` Skill

Run the `$review-plan` skill on the resolved artifact.

Always run this step even if the artifact looks polished.

## Step 3: Run `$evaluate-findings` Skill

Run the `$evaluate-findings` skill on the review findings from Step 2.

## Step 4: Run `$apply-findings` Skill

Run the `$apply-findings` skill on the evaluated results.

## Step 5: Re-run `$refine-plan` Skill if Changed

Check whether the artifact file(s) were edited during Step 4. Any edit counts.

Iteration 1 is the initial run; iteration 2 is the first auto-re-run; and so on. The loop is not capped; it terminates on its own: when a run makes no changes, when a round makes only prose-only edits, or when you judge a further re-run pointless.

**If changes were made**, classify what Step 4 edited:

- **Structural edits** — run `$refine-plan` again by reading and following the installed skill instructions, passing the artifact type and resolved path. If the round contains both structural and prose-only edits, treat it as structural and re-run automatically.
- **Prose-only edits only** (reworded sentences in place, fixed stale examples, clarified existing text without changing meaning) — the loop has converged. Output a summary of what changed and stop; do not re-run.

**If changes were made but you judge a re-run unnecessary**, output a summary of what changed and your reasoning for stopping, then stop instead of re-running.

**When the same class of defect recurs across iterations**, stop patching the individual instance and instead write the root-cause invariant into the artifact itself, enumerating the worked failures it must prevent. Treat recurrence on a new axis of the same invariant as a signal that the invariant is incomplete: widen it to cover the new axis rather than assuming the latest fix failed.

The re-invocation is a full, fresh run of this skill. Every step (1-5) executes with its own task tracking and skill invocations.

Then call `update_plan` to mark this step completed and continue with the next step of the active workflow.

### Structural Edit Examples by Type

- **Plan** — added or removed steps, new or removed design decisions, rewired dependencies between steps, changed testing strategy
- **Shells** — added or removed shells, changed Produces/Consumes/Covers Spec Requirements wiring, changed frontmatter `depends_on`, added or removed spec requirement coverage
- **Spec** — added or removed sections, new or removed requirements, rewired cross-references, changed acceptance criteria

## Rules

- Every step must run in every iteration. `$evaluate-findings` is a judgment gate that must run before `$apply-findings` touches the artifact. Each step must invoke its designated skill by reading and following the installed skill instructions.
- Re-invocations from Step 5 are full runs with fresh task tracking and complete skill invocations.
- The artifact file(s) are the only files that should change. For shells, do not modify the source spec.
