# Draft Shells

Decompose a specification file into shells at `.turbo/shells/<spec-slug>-NN-<title>.md`. Each shell represents one unit of work for a separate Codex session.

## Task Tracking

At the start, use `update_plan` to track each step, restating any remaining steps of a parent workflow alongside them:

1. Resolve the source spec
2. Decompose into shells
3. Resolve open questions
4. Write shell files
5. Present summary

If the confirmed shell count is one, the Single-Shell Bail-out at the end of Step 2 calls `update_plan` with a shortened step list (removing the remaining steps) and exits.

## Step 1: Resolve the Source Spec

Determine which spec to decompose using these rules in order:

1. **Explicit path** — If the user passed a file path, use it
2. **Explicit slug** — If a slug was passed, resolve to `.turbo/specs/<slug>.md`
3. **Single file** — Glob `.turbo/specs/*.md`. If exactly one file exists, use it
4. **Most recent** — If multiple files exist, use the most recently modified
5. **Legacy fallback** — If `.turbo/specs/` does not exist but `.turbo/spec.md` exists, use it
6. **Nothing found** — If no spec exists, nothing to decompose; stop

The slug of the resolved spec becomes the prefix for shell file names: a spec at `.turbo/specs/<slug>.md` produces shells at `.turbo/shells/<slug>-NN-<title>.md`. For the legacy fallback, use slug `legacy`.

State the resolved spec path and target shell directory before continuing.

Read the spec and identify:
- **Scope** — total surface area of work
- **Work categories** — UI, backend, data layer, infrastructure, tests, documentation, tooling
- **Spec requirements** — enumerate the `R<N>` IDs from the spec's `## Requirements` section. Every R-id must be tracked in at least one shell's Covers field.
- **Dependencies** — which pieces must exist before others can start
- **Greenfield vs existing** — is there an established codebase to work within
- **Open questions** — decisions the spec deferred that will need to be answered at implementation time

If the spec has no `## Requirements` section or contains no `R<N>`-numbered items, use `request_user_input` with two options: re-run `$draft-spec` (then restart Step 1 with the resulting spec) or stop so the user can add a `## Requirements` section with enumerated `R<N>` IDs manually. Shells depend on stable R-ids for coverage tracking.

## Step 2: Decompose Into Shells

Split the spec into shells, each a unit of work for a separate Codex session. The user sets the final count in the gate at the end of this step. The analysis here makes that choice informed: find where the work can be cut, name what must stay together, then recommend a count with options.

### Find the Seams

Identify where the work can be cut and the order pieces must land:

- **Dependency order** — foundational work before dependent work: setup and scaffolding (project init, config, CI), then the data and domain layer (models, schemas, types), then core business logic, then the API and service layer, then UI and frontend, then integration and end-to-end concerns. A hard dependency is a strong seam: a later piece cannot be drafted or expanded until an earlier piece's concrete output exists (generated types, framework wiring, patterns later sessions survey against).
- **Natural boundaries** — candidate cut points where one piece's output is another's input. A spec's suggested groupings are a starting point; treat them as candidate seams the count gate may regroup.

A seam is weak when cutting it buys nothing: the two sides share no ordering dependency and would sit comfortably in one session. Shared-nothing independence alone is a weak seam. A seam is strong when one side must exist before the other, or when keeping both sides in one session would overload it: too much code to read in full, too many distinct conventions to absorb, or too much output for one window.

### Keep Combined

Some pieces must share a shell regardless of the count the user picks:

- **Tightly-coupled pieces** — when UI, API, and tests are inseparable, keep them in one shell.
- **Atomic ripple** — when a breaking change to a shared interface requires every consumer across modules to update in lockstep, the change and all consumer updates land in one shell regardless of size. Splitting leaves intermediate states that break dependents.
- **Reachability** — each shell leaves the codebase fully integrated, with no components unreachable from the project's entry points. Bundle tightly-coupled producer/consumer pairs into one shell, or have a foundation shell include a minimal integration point (a single working endpoint or CLI command) that proves the code is reachable. When a shell builds infrastructure a later shell consumes, name that consumer in the Produces field.

These set the ceiling on the count: the work cannot split past the point where a combined piece would break.

Items folded into a shell go into that shell's Implementation Steps. If several folded items have no clear home, group them into a single "minor fixes" shell at the end.

### Wiring Invariants

For each shell, identify the structural contract with the rest of the decomposition:

- **Produces** — What this shell creates that other shells (or the final system) can use. List concrete artifacts at the conceptual level: modules, types, endpoints, data models, UI screens, migration files. File paths are filled in at expansion time.
- **Consumes** — What this shell depends on that must already exist. Either listed in a prior shell's Produces (and that producing shell named directly in this shell's frontmatter `depends_on`), or marked "from existing codebase" if it predates this decomposition. Every Consumes entry must be traceable to a source.
- **Covers spec requirements** — Which `R<N>` IDs from the spec's `## Requirements` section this shell implements. The union of Covers across all shells must equal the full set of R-ids in the spec. Every R-id must appear in at least one shell's Covers. Write one R-id per bullet in the Step 4 template. For partial coverage of a single R-id, mark the entry `R<N> (partial: <the slice this shell owns>)`. A bare `R<N>` is reserved for an R-id fully satisfied by one shell; a bare claim for partial coverage breaks the invariant. Two patterns spread an R-id across shells. **Split requirement:** the work partitions into pieces that together complete it, typically when one shell ships scaffolding or placeholders a later shell fills. Each contributing shell claims its owned slice; the owned slices must be non-overlapping and together complete the requirement, and none may claim it bare. **Cross-cutting obligation:** every (or several) shells must satisfy it independently, such as a per-shell quality gate. Each applicable shell claims its own instance as a partial; none may bare-claim it on one foundation shell, which would read done while later shells silently skip it. Do not invent variant annotations such as `(finished: ...)`, `(closing: ...)`, or `(completes: ...)`; use the owned-slice partial form.

### Shell Slug

Each shell gets a slug derived from its title using spec slug rules (lowercase, hyphenated, ≤40 chars), prefixed with the shell number: `<spec-slug>-NN-<title-slug>`. The shell keeps this file name when `$expand-shell` fills it in.

Example: spec slug `photo-sorter-v2`, Shell 3 titled "Build duplicate detection" → slug `photo-sorter-v2-03-build-duplicate-detection`, written to `.turbo/shells/photo-sorter-v2-03-build-duplicate-detection.md`.

### Recommend and Confirm Shell Count

Form a recommended count from the seams and combination constraints above. The trade-off: more shells each cost a fresh-session handoff (lost in-memory context, a repeated pattern survey, an extra `$pick-next-shell` round) and a full review pass of their own; fewer shells risk overloading a session. Land the recommendation where that balance falls: lean toward fewer when the seams are weak, toward more when a strong seam or session overload pushes the work apart. When the call is close, round down.

Output the recommendation as text: the recommended count, a one-line scope for each proposed shell, and a line or two on why that count over its neighbors. Then use `request_user_input` to have the user set the final count. Offer the recommended count first, marked "(Recommended)", alongside 1-2 alternative counts; when the recommended count is 2 or more, include at least one option below it so the leaner choice is always on offer; the auto-appended "Other" lets the user type any count.

If the user picks a different count, re-group to match it: merge adjacent shells to reduce, or split at a seam to raise, keeping combined pieces together. Carry the confirmed count into the rest of the decomposition.

### Single-Shell Bail-out

If the confirmed count is one shell, do not write a shell file. A one-shell decomposition is structurally equivalent to a plan: `depends_on` is empty, Covers lists every R-id, Produces/Consumes has no consumers, and `$pick-next-shell` automation has nothing to coordinate.

Present this message:

> Decomposition produced one shell, so no shell file was written. The spec at `<resolved spec path>` fits a single session and is plan-shaped.

Do not create `.turbo/shells/`. Then call `update_plan` with a step list that drops the remaining `$draft-shells` steps ("Resolve open questions", "Write shell files", "Present summary") and continue with the next step of the active workflow.

## Step 3: Resolve Open Questions

If no open questions emerged during decomposition or carried over from the spec, skip this step.

For each open question:

1. Analyze the question against the spec, decomposition context, and any consulted references. State the trade-offs of the leading options in plain text so the user can see the reasoning.
2. Use `request_user_input` to offer up to 2 concrete resolution options with short descriptions, plus a **Defer to expansion** option (leaves the question on the relevant shell's Open Questions list). Mark the strongest option "(Recommended)" and place it first. The auto-appended "Other" lets the user supply a freeform answer.
3. If resolved, update the in-memory decomposition (Produces, Consumes, Covers, Implementation Steps) to reflect the answer. If deferred, record it against the relevant shell in the in-memory decomposition.

If the user selects "Other" and provides a freeform answer, accept it and proceed.

Default to resolving. Defer only when the answer genuinely needs codebase or pattern-survey context that is not yet available.

If an answer would restructure the decomposition significantly (changes shell count, merges existing shells, or splits one shell into several), re-run Step 2 with the new constraint before continuing to Step 4. If the new count is 1, the Single-Shell Bail-out at the end of Step 2 applies.

## Step 4: Write Shell Files

Create `.turbo/shells/` if it does not exist. For each shell, write a file at `.turbo/shells/<shell-slug>.md` using this template:

````markdown
---
spec: <resolved spec path from Step 1>
depends_on: []
---

# Plan: <Shell Title>

## Context

<Why this work matters, drawn from relevant spec sections. Focus on the intended outcome. One or two paragraphs.>

## Produces

- <Conceptual artifact 1 — what it is, what it does>
- <Conceptual artifact 2>
- ...

## Consumes

- <Conceptual dependency 1 — from Shell N, or "from existing codebase">
- <Conceptual dependency 2>
- ...

## Covers Spec Requirements

- R<N>
- R<N>
- R<M> (partial: <owned slice>)
- ...

## Implementation Steps (High-Level)

1. **<Step title>**
   - <Description of what this step accomplishes at the conceptual level>
2. **<Step title>**
   - <Description>
3. ...

## Open Questions

- <Question deferred from spec, to be answered at expansion time>
- <Question>
- ...

## Expansion Deferred

The following are filled in when `$expand-shell` runs:

- Pattern survey against the codebase state at implementation time
- Concrete `file_path` references with named functions or symbols for each Implementation Step
- Verification section with specific test commands and smoke checks
- Context Files section with the files to read in full before editing
````

### Frontmatter Fields

- **spec** — Absolute or relative path to the source spec
- **depends_on** — List of shell file names (without `.md`) that must be expanded and implemented before this shell can be picked. Use `[]` for shells with no dependencies.

Example `depends_on` for Shell 3 that depends on Shells 1 and 2:
```yaml
depends_on: [photo-sorter-v2-01-setup, photo-sorter-v2-02-models]
```

If a shell has no Open Questions, include the section with "None" so the structure stays consistent.

## Step 5: Present Summary

Present a brief summary of the decomposition: number of shells, a one-line description of each shell's scope, and any assumptions made about ambiguities. When the project delivers value to a user, developer, or operator, also present a short list of stories capturing what that person gains, in the form "As a <persona>, I want <capability> so that <outcome>". Skip the stories only when no beneficiary or outcome can be named, such as a purely mechanical refactor. Fit both to the decomposition rather than a fixed template.

Then use `request_user_input` to offer two paths:

- **Approve** (Recommended) — the decomposition is final.
- **Revise** — the user describes what to change. Apply it, re-running Step 2 when the change is structural (it alters shell count or boundaries) and rewriting the affected shell files, then re-summarize and re-present.

After approval, tell the user the next step:

> To start implementation, run `$pick-next-shell`.

Then call `update_plan` to mark this step completed and continue with the next step of the active workflow.

## Rules

- Never merge setup and finalization into the same shell
- When it is ambiguous whether two pieces belong together, default to combining them into one candidate shell; the user can split at the gate
- Each shell must be self-contained with enough structural context (Context, Produces, Consumes, Covers) to understand the work without reading the full spec
- Shell files are the only outputs. Do not modify the spec or project files.
- Every Consumes entry must be backed by an explicit edge in the shell's frontmatter `depends_on` (or marked "from existing codebase").
- The union of all Covers fields must equal the full set of R-ids in the spec's `## Requirements` section. Every R-id must appear in at least one shell's Covers.
- Coverage notations: only bare `R<N>` (full, claimed exactly once) and `R<N> (partial: <the slice this shell owns>)`. Do not invent variants like `(finished: ...)`.
- When a requirement's work partitions across shells, each contributing shell claims its owned slice; owned slices must be non-overlapping and together complete it. Never co-occur a bare claim with a partial claim for the same R-id.
- A cross-cutting obligation every (or several) shells must satisfy independently is claimed by each applicable shell as its own instance, never bare on a single shell.
- Implementation Steps (High-Level) describe build work. Exclude `git commit`, `git push`, and PR creation.
