# Contribute Turbo

Submit staged turbo skill improvements from `~/.turbo/repo/` back to the upstream repo. The workflow adapts based on `repoMode` in `~/.turbo/config.json`.

## Step 1: Verify Contributor Status

Read `~/.turbo/config.json` and check `repoMode`:

- `"fork"` or `"source"` — proceed
- `"clone"` — tell the user that contributions require a fork. Offer to help convert their clone to a fork (add their fork as origin, rename current origin to upstream). Stop.
- Missing config or repo — tell the user to run the Turbo setup first. Stop.

Verify the repo exists and has the expected remotes:

```bash
git -C ~/.turbo/repo remote -v
```

## Step 2: Review Pending Changes

Check what changes exist in the local repo:

```bash
git -C ~/.turbo/repo diff --name-only
git -C ~/.turbo/repo diff --cached --name-only
```

If there are unstaged changes to skill files, stage the specific skill directories that changed:

```bash
git -C ~/.turbo/repo add skills/<name>/
```

If there are no changes at all, tell the user there is nothing to contribute and stop.

Present the changes in a summary table:

```
| # | Skill | Change Summary |
|---|-------|----------------|
| 1 | /evaluate-findings | Added handling for security-default findings |
| 2 | /self-improve | Clarified routing for trusted reviewer feedback |
```

Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm which changes to include. If the user deselects some, unstage those files.

## Step 3: Craft Contribution Context

For each change, construct a "why" explanation. The goal: the turbo maintainer should understand what happened and why the existing instructions were insufficient, without learning anything about the contributor's project.

Use this template:

> During [general workflow description], the skill's instructions [what was missing or wrong]. This caused [what happened]. The change [what it does] so that [benefit].

**Example:**

> During a code review session, the evaluate-findings skill encountered a finding with `security-default` severity. The existing instructions only handled `critical`, `high`, `medium`, and `low` severities, causing the finding to be silently dropped. The change adds `security-default` to the severity handling table so these findings are properly triaged.

### Privacy Filter

Before finalizing, verify each "why" description contains none of the following:

- Project or repo names
- File paths from the user's project
- Company or product names
- API keys, URLs, or credentials
- Business logic or domain-specific terminology that identifies the project
- User names beyond the contributor's GitHub handle

Show the drafted context to the user via `AskUserQuestion` for approval. The user must approve the contribution message before proceeding.

## Step 4: Commit Rules

Run `/commit-rules` to load commit message rules and technical constraints.

## Step 5: Create Branch and Commit

When multiple skills were changed, batch related changes into a single branch and commit. Create separate branches only when changes are independent and unrelated.

### Fork mode

Create a feature branch:

```bash
git -C ~/.turbo/repo checkout -b improve/<skill-name>-<short-desc>
```

Commit with a message matching the turbo repo style (check `git -C ~/.turbo/repo log -n 10 --oneline`). Incorporate the "why" context in the commit message.

### Source mode

Stay on main. Commit directly with the same message style.

## Step 6: Push

### Fork mode

Run `/github-voice` to load writing style rules.

Push and create a PR:

```bash
git -C ~/.turbo/repo push -u origin improve/<skill-name>-<short-desc>
```

Create the PR against the upstream repo:

```bash
gh pr create --repo tobihagemann/turbo --head <user>:improve/<skill-name>-<short-desc> --title "..." --body "..."
```

PR body format:

```markdown
## Summary
- [1-3 bullet points]

## Context
[The crafted "why" explanation from Step 3]
```

Return to main after creating the PR:

```bash
git -C ~/.turbo/repo checkout main
```

Report the PR URL.

### Source mode

Push directly:

```bash
git -C ~/.turbo/repo push origin main
```

Report the pushed commit hash.
