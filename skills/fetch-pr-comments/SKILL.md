# Fetch PR Comments

Fetch unresolved review comments and top-level review body comments from a GitHub PR and present them in a readable summary. This is a read-only skill -- it does not evaluate, fix, or reply to any comments.

## Step 1: Fetch Comments

Fetch review threads and top-level review body comments from the PR:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $pr: Int!) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
    pullRequest(number: $pr) {
      title url
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          id isResolved isOutdated
          comments(first: 50) {
            nodes { author { login } body path line originalLine diffHunk }
          }
        }
      }
      reviews(first: 50) {
        nodes {
          author { login }
          body state
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' -f owner='{owner}' -f repo='{repo}' -F pr={pr_number}
```

Auto-detect owner, repo, and PR number from current branch if not provided. Filter review threads to unresolved only. Filter reviews to those with a non-empty body, excluding `PENDING` state (unsubmitted drafts).

## Step 2: Present Results

Display a summary header followed by comments grouped by file.

**Summary header:**

- PR title and link
- Branch: `head` -> `base`
- Total threads / unresolved threads

**Top-level review comments (if any):**

Show reviews with non-empty body before the file-grouped threads:

```
## Review Comments

### @reviewer (CHANGES_REQUESTED)
> Review body text here

### @another-reviewer (COMMENTED)
> Another review body here
```

**Inline threads grouped by file:**

For each file with unresolved threads, show:

````
## `path/to/file.ts`

### Line 42 (by @reviewer)
```diff
<diffHunk from first comment>
```
> Comment body here

### Line 10 (by @another-reviewer) [outdated]
```diff
<diffHunk from first comment>
```
> First comment body
>
> **@reply-author:** Reply body
````

**Formatting rules:**
- Show top-level review body comments first, grouped under "Review Comments"
- Then group threads by file path, in the order they appear
- Within each file, order threads by line number
- Show the `diffHunk` from the first comment in each thread as a fenced diff code block before the comment body. This is the code context the reviewer was looking at.
- For the line number, use `line` if available. Fall back to `originalLine` for outdated comments where `line` is null.
- Show all comments in a thread (the first is the original review comment; subsequent ones are replies)
- Mark outdated threads with `[outdated]`
- Use blockquotes for comment bodies
- For threads with multiple comments, show each comment with its author
- If there are zero unresolved threads and zero review body comments, say so and stop

Check your task list for remaining tasks and proceed.

## Rules

- If the user wants to fix or reply to comments, direct them to use `/resolve-pr-comments`.
