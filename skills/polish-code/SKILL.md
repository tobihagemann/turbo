# Polish Code

## Task Tracking

At the start of every invocation (including re-runs from Step 8), use `TaskCreate` to create a task for each step:

1. Run `/stage` skill
2. Deterministic cleanup
3. Run `/simplify-code` skill
4. Run `/review-code` and `/peer-review` skills
5. Run `/evaluate-findings` skill
6. Run `/apply-findings` skill
7. Run `/smoke-test` skill
8. Re-run `/polish-code` skill if changed

## Step 1: Run `/stage` Skill

Run the `/stage` skill.

## Step 2: Deterministic Cleanup

Run the project's formatter first, then the linter. Fix any lint errors or warnings that the formatter did not resolve. If the project has a combined format+lint script, use that.

Run the project's test suite to confirm nothing is broken. If tests fail, run the `/investigate` skill to diagnose the root cause, apply the suggested fix, and re-run tests. If investigation cannot identify a root cause, stop and report with investigation findings.

Stage all changes made in this step before continuing.

## Step 3: Run `/simplify-code` Skill

Run the `/simplify-code` skill. The diff command is `git diff --cached`.

Stage all changes made in this step before continuing.

## Step 4: Run `/review-code` and `/peer-review` Skills

Run the `/review-code` and `/peer-review` skills on the staged changes. The diff command is `git diff --cached`. Read both skills' instructions, then launch all Agent tool calls in a single message so they run concurrently.

Always run this step even if Step 3 made no changes.

## Step 5: Run `/evaluate-findings` Skill

Run the `/evaluate-findings` skill on the results from Steps 3 and 4.

## Step 6: Run `/apply-findings` Skill

Run the `/apply-findings` skill on the evaluated results.

Stage all changes made in this step before continuing.

## Step 7: Run `/smoke-test` Skill

Run the `/smoke-test` skill to produce the smoke test plan. Delegate test execution to a subagent using the Agent tool (`model: "opus"`, do not set `run_in_background`). Pass the plan and the diff command (`git diff --cached`) to the subagent.

If any test fails, fix the issues and stage the fixes.

## Step 8: Re-run `/polish-code` Skill if Changed

Check whether any file was edited during Steps 6-7. Earlier changes do not trigger a re-run because `/review-code` already reviewed them. Any post-review edit counts, regardless of how small or mechanical it seems.

**If post-review changes were made**, classify what Steps 6-7 edited:

- **Structural edits** (fixed bugs, new or removed functions, changed function signatures, moved code between files, changed control flow, added or removed dependencies, corrected a stale or wrong comment that was itself a documentation bug) — run `/polish-code` again using the Skill tool. Scope the diff command to only the files modified in Steps 6-7: use `git diff --cached -- <file1> <file2> ...` as the diff command for `/simplify-code` and `/review-code`. Smoke test scope remains unchanged (full feature scope, not file-narrowed). If the round contains both structural and in-place edits, treat it as structural and re-run automatically.
- **In-place edits only** (renamed local variables without changing behavior, reformatted, adjusted whitespace, edited neutral comments) — output a summary of what changed, then use `AskUserQuestion` to ask whether to run one more round or stop here. Do not silently continue or silently stop.

**If post-review changes were made but you believe re-running is unnecessary**, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask for skip permission. Do not skip silently.

**If this is iteration 3 and post-review changes were still made**, the hard cap is reached. This replaces the classification gate above. Output a summary of what is still changing and whether it is structural or in-place. Then use `AskUserQuestion` to offer three options: continue for another iteration, stop here and accept the current state, or escalate to `/consult-oracle` for a different perspective on the remaining issues.

The re-invocation is a full, fresh run of this skill. Every step (1-8) executes with its own task tracking and skill invocations. "Scoped to modified files" only affects the diff command passed to `/simplify-code` and `/review-code`. It does not affect which steps run or whether skills are invoked.

Check your task list for remaining tasks and proceed.

## Rules

- Every step must run in every iteration. Each step uses distinct agents with non-overlapping review criteria. `/simplify-code` and `/review-code` have different focus areas. `/evaluate-findings` is a judgment gate that must run before `/apply-findings`.
- Each step must invoke its designated skill via the Skill tool, not be replaced by inline reasoning or agent calls.
- Re-invocations from Step 8 are full runs with fresh task tracking and complete skill invocations.
