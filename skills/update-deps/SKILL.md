# Update Dependencies

Upgrade project dependencies, researching breaking changes for major version updates.

Optional filter: `$ARGUMENTS` (e.g., `react`, `Alamofire`, `serde tokio`)

## Phase 1: Detect Package Managers

Identify which package managers are in use by searching for config files:

| Config file | Package manager | Lockfile | Ecosystem |
|---|---|---|---|
| `package.json` | npm / yarn / pnpm | `package-lock.json` / `yarn.lock` / `pnpm-lock.yaml` | Node.js |
| `Package.swift`, `*.xcodeproj` | Swift Package Manager | `Package.resolved` | Swift |
| `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.py` | pip / poetry / uv | `poetry.lock`, `uv.lock` | Python |
| `Cargo.toml` | cargo | `Cargo.lock` | Rust |
| `go.mod` | Go modules | `go.sum` | Go |
| `Gemfile` | Bundler | `Gemfile.lock` | Ruby |
| `pom.xml` | Maven | — | Java |
| `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts` | Gradle | `gradle.lockfile` | Java/Kotlin |

Swift dependencies can live in `Package.swift` or be configured directly in the Xcode project file (`.xcodeproj`/`.xcworkspace`). For Xcode-managed dependencies, inspect the project's package references.

Detection steps:

1. Search for config files in the project root and subdirectories (exclude vendored directories)
2. If a lockfile exists, use the corresponding package manager variant (e.g., `yarn.lock` → yarn, `pnpm-lock.yaml` → pnpm)
3. If **multiple instances of the same package manager** found (e.g., monorepo with several `package.json` files): use AskUserQuestion to let the user choose which to update (multiSelect allowed)
4. If **multiple package managers** found: use AskUserQuestion to let the user choose which to update
5. If **none** found: inform user and exit

## Phase 2: Discovery

Run the appropriate discovery command to find available updates:

| Package manager | Discovery command | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| npm | `ncu --format group` | Requires `npm-check-updates`. Suggest `npm install -g npm-check-updates` if missing. |
| yarn | `ncu --format group` or `yarn upgrade-interactive` | |
| pnpm | `ncu --format group` or `pnpm outdated` | |
| Swift PM | Check resolved versions in `Package.resolved` against latest releases via WebSearch | No built-in outdated command. Read `Package.swift` or inspect the Xcode project to identify dependencies and their current version constraints. |
| pip | `pip list --outdated` | |
| poetry | `poetry show --outdated` | |
| uv | `uv pip list --outdated` | |
| cargo | `cargo outdated` | Requires `cargo-outdated`. Fall back to comparing `Cargo.toml` versions via WebSearch. |
| Go modules | `go list -m -u all` | |
| Bundler | `bundle outdated` | |
| Maven | `mvn versions:display-dependency-updates` | |
| Gradle | `gradle dependencyUpdates` | Requires `com.github.ben-manes.versions` plugin. |

If a filter was provided via `$ARGUMENTS`, restrict discovery to matching packages.

Categorize updates:
- **Major** (breaking changes) — requires migration research
- **Minor** (new features, backward compatible)
- **Patch** (bug fixes)

If no updates are available, inform the user and exit.

## Phase 3: User Strategy Selection

Present a summary showing:
- Count and list of major updates (with current → target versions)
- Count of minor updates
- Count of patch updates

Use AskUserQuestion for upgrade strategy:

**Header**: "Strategy"
**Options**:
- **Cautious** — Upgrade minor/patch first, then major one-by-one with research
- **All at once** — Research all major changes, then upgrade everything together
- **Skip major** — Only upgrade minor and patch versions
- **Interactive** — Ask for each major update individually

## Phase 4: Research Breaking Changes

For **each package with a major version update**:

### Step 1: Calculate Version Gap

Identify all major versions between current and target. For example:
- `react: 17.0.2 → 19.0.0` → research v18 AND v19 breaking changes
- `Alamofire: 4.9.1 → 6.0.0` → research v5 AND v6 breaking changes

### Step 2: Research Each Major Version

Search for migration documentation:

```
WebSearch: "[package-name] v[X] migration guide"
WebSearch: "[package-name] v[X] breaking changes"
```

Common sources: GitHub releases page, official docs, changelog files.

### Step 3: Extract Key Breaking Changes

Identify: API changes (renamed/removed functions), configuration changes, peer/transitive dependency requirements, behavioral changes, deprecated features now removed.

### Step 4: Search Codebase for Affected Code

Use Grep to find usage of deprecated or changed APIs. Document which files are affected and what changes are needed.

## Phase 5: User Confirmation

For each major update, present:
- Package name and version transition
- Breaking changes found (summarized)
- Files potentially affected (count and list)

Use AskUserQuestion to confirm:

**Header**: "Confirm"
**Options**:
- **Proceed** — Continue with upgrades and migrations
- **Show details** — Display detailed breaking changes for review
- **Skip package** — Exclude a specific package from upgrade
- **Abort** — Cancel the upgrade process

If "Show details" selected, display full migration research, then ask again.

## Phase 6: Execute Upgrades

### Cautious Strategy

First upgrade minor and patch only using the package manager's semver-respecting update command, then run tests. If tests fail, stop before proceeding with major upgrades.

### Major Version Upgrades

Update the manifest file (version constraint) and run the install/resolve command. For package managers with a dedicated upgrade command, use it. For others (Swift PM, Maven, Gradle), edit the manifest directly.

## Phase 7: Apply Migrations

### Step 1: Run Codemods (if Available)

Some ecosystems provide automated migration tools:

| Ecosystem | Migration tools |
|---|---|
| React | `npx react-codemod [transform]` |
| Next.js | `npx @next/codemod [transform]` |
| Jest | `npx jest-codemods` |
| Angular | `npx ng update` |
| Rust | `cargo fix` for edition migrations |
| Python | `pyupgrade`, `python-modernize` |

### Step 2: Manual Code Changes

For changes requiring manual intervention:
1. Read the affected file
2. Apply the necessary transformation using Edit
3. Show the user what changed

### Step 3: Update Configuration Files

If configuration format changed, read current config, transform to new format, write updated config.

## Phase 8: Verification

Run the project's test, build, and lint commands. Detect which commands are available from the project's config files and scripts. Use project-level task runners when present (`Makefile`, `Taskfile`, `justfile`, npm scripts, etc.).

### Report Results

Summarize: packages upgraded (count), breaking changes addressed (count), files modified (count), test results, remaining manual tasks.

### Recommend Next Steps

If any migrations could not be automated:
- List specific changes the user needs to review
- Highlight deprecated patterns that need attention
- Note any runtime behavior changes to watch for

## Error Handling

### Discovery Tool Not Available

If the discovery tool is not installed, suggest the installation command (see Phase 2 notes column). If no tool exists for the ecosystem, fall back to manual version checking via WebSearch.

### Network Errors During Research

If WebSearch/WebFetch fails: retry with alternative search terms, provide manual research links, proceed with caution warning that migration research may be incomplete.

### Test Failures After Upgrade

- Stop the upgrade process
- Suggest rollback: restore manifest and lockfile from git, then reinstall
- Identify which package likely caused the failure

### Migration Research Incomplete

If official migration docs are not found: check the package's repository for issues and discussions, note as "migration research incomplete — proceed with caution."
