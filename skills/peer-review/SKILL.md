# Peer Review

Independent peer review via codex. Runs `/codex-exec` in read-only mode with a review prompt built from the input material.

## Step 1: Determine What to Review

Determine what to review from the input material (passed in via Agent task context) or from conversation context. If neither provides reviewable material, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask what to review.

## Step 2: Run `/codex-exec` Skill

Launch an Agent tool call (`model: "opus"`, do not set `run_in_background`) to run the `/codex-exec` skill in read-only mode with a review prompt tailored to the material. Include the output format in a `<structured_output_contract>` tag:

```
<structured_output_contract>
For each issue, return:

### [P<N>] <title (imperative, ≤80 chars)>

**File:** `<file path>` or **Section:** <location>

<one paragraph explaining the issue and its impact>

Use priorities: P0 (fundamentally flawed), P1 (significant gap), P2 (moderate issue), P3 (minor improvement).
After all findings, add an Overall Verdict section with a 1-3 sentence assessment.
If no issues, state that it looks sound.
</structured_output_contract>
```

When the prompt covers **multiple review dimensions** (e.g., correctness, security, quality, API usage), wrap the task list with parallel fan-out instructions so codex delegates each dimension to a separate sub-agent. See `/codex-exec` [references/parallel-execution.md](../codex-exec/references/parallel-execution.md) for details on codex parallel execution.

## Step 3: Output Findings

Output the codex findings.
