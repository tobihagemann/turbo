# Peer Review

Independent peer review via codex. Runs `/codex-exec` in read-only mode with a review prompt that was passed in or derived from context.

## Step 1: Identify the Review Prompt

Determine the review prompt:

- If a **review prompt was passed in** (in the Agent task context), use it as-is
- If **no prompt was provided** (standalone invocation), determine what to review from conversation context and build a prompt using `/codex-exec` XML tags (`<task>`, `<structured_output_contract>`, and optionally `<dig_deeper_nudge>`)

When building a standalone prompt, use P0-P3 priorities: P0 (fundamentally flawed), P1 (significant gap), P2 (moderate issue), P3 (minor improvement). Example:

```
<task>
Review the following for issues that would cause incorrect behavior or get an implementer stuck.
</task>

<structured_output_contract>
For each issue: (1) problem, (2) location, (3) impact, (4) suggested fix, (5) priority P0-P3.
If no issues, state that it looks sound.
</structured_output_contract>
```

## Step 2: Run `/codex-exec` Skill

Run the `/codex-exec` skill in read-only mode with the review prompt.

When the prompt covers **multiple review dimensions** (e.g., correctness, security, quality, API usage), wrap the task list with parallel fan-out instructions so codex delegates each dimension to a separate sub-agent. Add to the prompt:

```
Delegate each review dimension to a separate sub-agent using spawn_agent so they run in parallel. Wait for all agents to complete, then synthesize their findings into a unified report.
```

See `/codex-exec` [references/parallel-execution.md](../codex-exec/references/parallel-execution.md) for details on codex parallel execution.

## Step 3: Output Findings

Output the codex findings.
