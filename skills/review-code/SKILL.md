description: "Review code for bugs, security vulnerabilities, quality issues, API misuse, or test coverage gaps by running internal reviews and a peer review in parallel and returning combined findings. Single-concern with a type argument, or full review with no argument. Use when the user asks to \"review my code\", \"full code review\", \"review my changes\", \"check for bugs\", \"scan for bugs\", \"review correctness\", \"security audit\", \"find vulnerabilities\", \"review security\", \"check for duplication\", \"review quality\", \"check API usage\", \"verify against docs\", \"find untested code\", or \"review test coverage\"."

# Review Code

Review code against type-specific criteria. Runs internal reviews and `/peer-review` in parallel by default. Returns combined structured findings.

**Types:** `correctness`, `security`, `quality`, `api-usage`, `coverage`

With a type argument, runs a single-concern internal review plus the peer review. With no type argument, runs all five internal reviews plus the peer review.

## Step 1: Determine the Scope

Determine what to review:

- If a specific **diff command** was provided (e.g., `git diff --cached`, `git diff main...HEAD`), use that.
- If a **file list or directory** was provided, review those files directly (read the full files, not a diff).
- If **neither** was provided, default to diffing against the repository's default branch (detect via `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name'`). If there are no changes against the default branch, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask what to review.

## Step 2: Run Reviews in Parallel

Read the reference file(s) for the active type(s):

- **Correctness** — [references/correctness-review.md](references/correctness-review.md)
- **Security** — [references/security-review.md](references/security-review.md)
- **Quality** — [references/quality-review.md](references/quality-review.md)
- **API usage** — [references/api-usage-review.md](references/api-usage-review.md)
- **Coverage** — [references/coverage-review.md](references/coverage-review.md)

Full review activates all five types; a single-concern argument activates one. Skip peer review when the caller asked (e.g., "without peer review", "no peer", "internal only").

Launch one Agent tool call per active type plus one for `/peer-review` (unless skipping), all in a single message (`model: "opus"`, do not set `run_in_background`). Each internal Agent receives the scope and its reference file content, applies the criteria, and returns findings in the output format below. The peer-review Agent invokes `/peer-review` via the Skill tool with a prompt embedding the "What to Review", determination criteria, priority levels, and verdict label from every active reference file, structured with `<task>`, `<dig_deeper_nudge>`, and `<structured_output_contract>` XML tags.

Aggregate findings with attribution (reviewer: "internal" or "peer"; type; file path). Present them in the output format below.

Check your task list for remaining tasks and proceed.

## Output Format

Return findings as a numbered list. For each finding:

```
### [P<N>] <title (imperative, ≤80 chars)>

**File:** `<file path>` (lines <start>-<end>)
**Reviewer:** <internal | peer> (<type>)

<one paragraph explaining the issue and its impact>
```

The reference file may specify additional metadata fields (e.g., `**Category:**`, `**Library:**`, `**Docs:**`). Include them between the `**Reviewer:**` line and the paragraph.

After all findings, add an overall verdict per active type using the label from each reference file. For single-concern, that is one verdict block; for full review, five. After the per-type verdicts, add a single combined `## Peer Review Verdict` block summarizing what codex returned.

```
## Overall Verdict — <type>

**<Verdict Label>:** <status>

<1-3 sentence assessment>
```

If there are no qualifying findings for a type, state so under that type's verdict block and explain briefly.

## Rules

- Present findings grouped by priority.
- In full code review mode, present findings in file order to minimize context switching.
