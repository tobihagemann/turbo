# Review Code

Run six AI code reviews in parallel and return combined findings.

## Step 1: Determine the Scope

Determine what to review:

- If a specific **diff command** was provided (e.g., `git diff --cached`), use that.
- If a **file list or directory** was provided, review those files directly.
- If **neither** was provided, default to diffing against the repository's default branch (detect via `gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef --jq '.defaultBranchRef.name'`).

## Step 2: Run Six Reviews in Parallel

Launch six Agent tool calls in a single message so they run concurrently (`model: "opus"`, do not set `run_in_background`). Each agent's prompt includes the scope from Step 1 and instructs it to invoke its assigned skill via the Skill tool:

- `/review-test-coverage`
- `/review-correctness`
- `/review-security`
- `/review-quality`
- `/review-api-usage`
- `/peer-review`

For the `/peer-review` agent, the Agent tool call prompt instructs the subagent to: (1) read the SKILL.md of every other review skill listed above, (2) extract their review criteria and "what to look for" sections, (3) compose a single comprehensive review prompt covering all dimensions with the diff command from Step 1, being verbose about what to check, and (4) invoke `/peer-review` via the Skill tool with the composed prompt.

## Step 3: Aggregate Combined Findings

Wait for all six agents to complete. Aggregate their findings with attribution (reviewer name, file path, description).

## Rules

- If any reviewer is unavailable or returns malformed output, proceed with findings from the remaining reviewers.
- Present findings in file order to minimize context switching.
