# Evaluate Findings

Confidence-based framework for evaluating external feedback (code reviews, AI suggestions, PR comments). Spawn a Devil's Advocate subagent to critically challenge non-trivial claims using research tools. Triage and classify findings — do not apply fixes. Return results for the main agent to act on.

## Step 1: Assess Each Finding

For each finding:

1. **Read the referenced code** at the mentioned location — include the full function or logical block, not just the flagged line
2. **Verify the claim** against the actual code — does the issue genuinely exist?
3. **Assign confidence**:

| Level | Criteria | Verdict |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **High** (>80%) | Clear bug, typo, missing check, obvious improvement, style violation matching project conventions | Accept |
| **Medium** (50-80%) | Likely valid but involves judgment calls or unclear project intent | Accept with caveats |
| **Low** (<50%) | Subjective preference, requires domain knowledge, might break things, reviewer may be wrong | Skip |

## Step 2: Devil's Advocate

After the initial assessment, spawn a subagent to critically challenge findings from a different angle using research tools.

### Spawn Condition

Spawn when there are **3 or more findings scored Medium or higher** that involve non-trivial claims — API behavior, correctness arguments, performance assertions, or anything not verifiable by reading the code alone.

**Skip** when all findings are clear-cut (typos, missing null checks, style issues) or total count is 1-2 trivial items.

### Subagent Instructions

Launch a single subagent using the `Agent` tool (foreground — results are needed before presenting). Provide:

1. The challenge-worthy findings with file locations, claims, and initial verdicts
2. Instructions to challenge each finding — try to prove it wrong, or confirm it with evidence

The subagent picks research tools based on claim type:

| Claim Type | Tool |
|------------|------|
| API deprecated/removed/changed | Documentation MCP tools or WebSearch |
| Method doesn't exist / wrong signature | Documentation MCP tools, WebSearch fallback |
| Code causes specific bug or behavior | Bash (isolated read-only test snippet) |
| Best practice or ecosystem claim | WebSearch |
| Migration or changelog lookup | WebSearch → WebFetch |

Use whatever documentation tools are available — MCP servers, relevant skills, WebSearch/WebFetch as fallback. The specific tools vary by project setup.

**Budget:** max 2 research actions per finding. If the first action is conclusive, skip the second.

### Subagent Verdicts

The subagent returns per finding:

- **Confirmed** — found evidence supporting the claim (with source)
- **Disputed** — found counter-evidence (with source and explanation)
- **Inconclusive** — no definitive evidence either way

## Step 3: Reconciliation

Merge subagent results with the initial assessment:

- **Confirmed**: verdict stands, confidence may increase. Note the evidence source.
- **Disputed**: if originally Accepted → downgrade to Skip or flag with both perspectives. Never silently override — show the disagreement.
- **Inconclusive**: verdict stands, note the uncertainty.

Findings not investigated by the subagent keep their original assessment unchanged.

For accepted findings (high/medium confidence), document what the issue is and where. For medium confidence, note assumptions and risks. For skipped findings (low confidence), document why the suggestion was not accepted and what additional context would be needed to reconsider.

## Step 4: Present Results

Present a summary table.

When the Devil's Advocate subagent was **not** spawned:

| File | Issue | Confidence | Verdict |
|------|-------|------------|---------|

When the subagent ran, add an Investigated column:

| File | Issue | Confidence | Verdict | Investigated |
|------|-------|------------|---------|--------------|

Where Investigated shows:
- *(empty)* — not investigated by subagent
- **Confirmed** (source) — subagent found supporting evidence
- **Disputed: [reason]** — subagent found counter-evidence

For disputed findings, add a callout below the table showing both perspectives.

## Rules

- Never auto-dismiss findings about security defaults, permission escalation, or fail-open vs fail-closed behavior just because a plan or implementation intent specifies different behavior. Plans can have incorrect assumptions about what the safe default should be. Always surface these findings to the user even if you believe the behavior was intentional.
- If a finding references code that no longer exists or has since changed, skip it and note that the code has diverged.
- If two findings conflict with each other, skip both and document the conflict.
- For each finding, clarify whether the issue was introduced by the PR/changeset or is pre-existing. Present this distinction explicitly so the user can decide whether it belongs in this PR's scope.
- Pre-existing issues in earlier commits on the same feature branch are in-scope by default — the entire branch is one coherent unit of work. Do not auto-skip findings just because they touch code from a prior commit in the branch.
