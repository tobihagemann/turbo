# Refine Plan

Loop the review pipeline over a planning artifact until no new findings are accepted. Writes back to the artifact file(s) in place. Supports plans, shells, and specs.

## Task Tracking

At the start of every invocation (including re-runs from Step 5), use `TaskCreate` to create a task for each step:

1. Resolve the artifact
2. Run `/review-plan` and `/peer-review` skills
3. Run `/evaluate-findings` skill
4. Run `/apply-findings` skill
5. Re-run `/refine-plan` skill if changed

## Step 1: Resolve the Artifact

### Determine Artifact Type

1. **Explicit argument** — If the user specified a type (e.g., "refine plan", "refine shells", "refine spec"), use it
2. **Conversation context** — Infer from conversation (e.g., if `/draft-plan` just ran, type is plan)
3. **Auto-detect** — Check `.turbo/` for existing artifacts. If multiple types exist, use `AskUserQuestion`

### Resolve the Artifact File(s)

#### Plan

1. **Explicit path** — use it
2. **Explicit slug** — resolve to `.turbo/plans/<slug>.md`
3. **Single file** — Glob `.turbo/plans/*.md`. If exactly one file exists, use it
4. **Most recent** — most recently modified file
5. **Legacy fallback** — `.turbo/plan.md` if `.turbo/plans/` does not exist
6. **Nothing found** — tell the user to run `/turboplan` (for a new task) or `/pick-next-shell` (for existing shells) and stop

#### Shells

1. **Explicit spec slug** — Glob `.turbo/shells/<slug>-*.md`
2. **Explicit spec path** — derive slug from filename, glob as above
3. **Single spec** — Glob `.turbo/specs/*.md`. If exactly one, derive slug and glob for shells
4. **Most recent spec** — most recently modified spec, derive slug and glob
5. **Nothing found** — tell the user to run `/draft-shells` first and stop

For shells, read each shell file and extract from its YAML frontmatter: `spec` (source spec path) and `depends_on`. Verify the source spec exists. State the spec path, number of shells, and each shell's filename.

#### Spec

1. **Explicit path** — use it
2. **Explicit slug** — resolve to `.turbo/specs/<slug>.md`
3. **Single file** — Glob `.turbo/specs/*.md`. If exactly one, use it
4. **Most recent** — most recently modified
5. **Legacy fallback** — `.turbo/spec.md` if `.turbo/specs/` does not exist
6. **Nothing found** — tell the user to run `/draft-spec` first and stop

If multiple candidates exist and the choice is non-obvious, use `AskUserQuestion`.

State the resolved path(s) before continuing.

## Step 2: Run `/review-plan` and `/peer-review` Skills

Run the `/review-plan` and `/peer-review` skills on the resolved artifact. Read both skills' instructions, then launch all Agent tool calls in a single message so they run concurrently. Aggregate findings with attribution (reviewer: "internal" or "peer").

Always run this step even if the artifact looks polished.

## Step 3: Run `/evaluate-findings` Skill

Run the `/evaluate-findings` skill on the review findings from Step 2.

## Step 4: Run `/apply-findings` Skill

Run the `/apply-findings` skill on the evaluated results.

## Step 5: Re-run `/refine-plan` Skill if Changed

Check whether the artifact file(s) were edited during Step 4. Any edit counts.

The iteration number below refers to the `/refine-plan` run currently executing Step 5. It is not the iteration number of a prospective re-run. Iteration 1 is the initial run; iteration 2 is the first auto-re-run; iteration 3 is the second auto-re-run; iteration 4 and beyond exist only when the user opts in at the hard-cap ask. Iterations 1 and 2 always follow the classification gate (they never trigger the hard cap at their own Step 5, even when the auto-re-run they spawn would be iteration 3). The hard cap fires at the end of iteration 3 and every iteration thereafter.

**Iterations 1 and 2, if changes were made**, classify what Step 4 edited:

- **Structural edits** — run `/refine-plan` again via the Skill tool, passing the artifact type and resolved path. If the round contains both structural and prose-only edits, treat it as structural and re-run automatically.
- **Prose-only edits only** (reworded sentences in place, fixed stale examples, clarified existing text without changing meaning) — output a summary of what changed, then use `AskUserQuestion` to ask whether to run one more round or stop here. Do not silently continue or silently stop.

**Iterations 1 and 2, if changes were made but you believe re-running is unnecessary**, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask for skip permission. Do not skip silently.

**Iteration 3 or later, if Step 4 of this run made changes**, the hard cap is reached. This replaces the classification gate above for iteration 3 and every iteration after it. Output a summary of what is still changing and whether it is structural or prose-only. Then use `AskUserQuestion` to offer three options: continue for another iteration, stop here and accept the artifact as-is, or escalate to `/consult-oracle` for a different perspective on the remaining issues.

The re-invocation is a full, fresh run of this skill. Every step (1-5) executes with its own task tracking and skill invocations.

Check your task list for remaining tasks and proceed.

### Structural Edit Examples by Type

- **Plan** — added or removed steps, new or removed design decisions, rewired dependencies between steps, changed testing strategy
- **Shells** — added or removed shells, changed Produces/Consumes/Covers Spec Requirements wiring, changed frontmatter `depends_on`, added or removed spec requirement coverage
- **Spec** — added or removed sections, new or removed requirements, rewired cross-references, changed acceptance criteria

## Rules

- Every step must run in every iteration. `/evaluate-findings` is a judgment gate that must run before `/apply-findings` touches the artifact. Each step must invoke its designated skill via the Skill tool.
- Re-invocations from Step 5 are full runs with fresh task tracking and complete skill invocations.
- The artifact file(s) are the only files that should change. For shells, do not modify the source spec.
- If any reviewer is unavailable or returns malformed output, proceed with findings from the remaining reviewer.
